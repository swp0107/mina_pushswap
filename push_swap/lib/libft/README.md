# **libft**

## Description of the project
##### Libft is my first project in 42 Silicon Valley School. The goal of this project is to build a library of useful functions that I will be reuse in most of my C projects. 

## What I learned from this project
##### The purpose of this project is to rewrite useful standard functions that will be used in C projects. To use the standard functions, it is essential to understand them. Also, by making my own library, I am able to expand the list of functions that I can use for all of my C projects. 

## Mandatory part
##### Global variables are forbidden to use.
##### Re-code a set of libc functions, as defined in their man. 
##### Same prototype and behaviors as the originals. 

## Bonus Part
##### After completing the mandatory part, you can make additional functions that can be added to your own library. Once you understand the behaviors of standard functions and have fun using them, you can make your own functions that you think you would need for your future projects.
